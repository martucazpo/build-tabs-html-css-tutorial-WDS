# build-tabs-html-css-tutorial-WDS

This great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L6h_MrNvsk&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8DWL14Wud_m8NeNNbYKOkj&index=30) from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) is a great introduction to functional javascript. The javascript is used to enhance the functionality of the HTML and the CSS. None of the code is mine.

Here are the tabs when the page is opened. The 'Home' tab is the default.
